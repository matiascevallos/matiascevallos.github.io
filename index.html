							<h2>Matias Cevallos</h2>
							<p>I am a dedicated and innovative computer science graduate with a strong academic background and diverse work experiences that blend technical expertise with business acumen. During my time at the University of British Columbia, I excelled in relevant coursework such as Software Engineering, Project Management, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics, earning a place on the Deanâ€™s Honour Roll. My professional journey includes impactful roles at SAP, where I honed my software development skills, collaborating with senior developers in an Agile environment to optimize software functionality using Java and other technologies. At Dark Byte Research, I applied advanced machine learning techniques in Python to significantly enhance investment timing accuracy and optimize data processes, contributing to a notable increase in profits. Additionally, my tenure as a Data Analyst Intern at Tropical Foods SA allowed me to develop and test prescriptive models, establish valuable client relationships, and create data-driven dashboards using SQL and Tableau. These experiences have equipped me with a versatile skill set, a proactive problem-solving mindset, and a proven ability to bridge technical and business domains effectively. <a</a></p>
